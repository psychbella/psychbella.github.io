My first post! I am a masters (and soon to be PhD) student in experimental psychology with an interest in learning about programming. I'm currently learning:
- Python
- PsychoPy
- R
And its been quite fun I must say. I enjoy trying to figure out how the logic flows in programming, though it is frustrating at times.
